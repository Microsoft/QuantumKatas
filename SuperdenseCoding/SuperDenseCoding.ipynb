    "# Superdense Coding Kata\n",
    "\n",
    "**Superdense Coding** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed to get you familiar with programming in Q#.\n",
    "\n",
    "It covers the superdense coding protocol which allows us to transmit two bits of classical information by sending just one qubit using previously shared quantum entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task. Each task (except tasks in which you have to write a test) has a unit test associated with it, which initially fails. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment) with some Q# code to make the failing test pass. To verify your answer, run the cell using Ctrl/âŒ˜+Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task defines an operation that can be used in subsequent tasks to simplify implementations and build on existing code.  We split the superdense coding protocol into several steps, following the description at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparation (creating the entangled pair of qubits that are sent to Alice and Bob).\n",
    "* Encoding the message (Alice's task): Encoding the classical bits of the message into the state of Alice's qubit which then is sent to Bob.\n",
    "* Decoding the message (Bob's task): Using Bob's original qubit and the qubit he received from Alice to decode the classical message sent.\n",
    "* Finally, we compose those steps into the complete superdense coding protocol."
