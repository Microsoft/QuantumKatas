This is a Q# kata for the Mermin-Peres magic square game, a quantum game where
the players use entangled qubits to help them win. The tests for each task in
the kata can be run using the "test" task in Visual Studio Code or with the
`dotnet test` command.

The kata also contains an interactive version of the magic square game where you
play as the "adversary" who chooses the row and column for Alice and Bob. You
can also choose which strategy Alice and Bob use. Experiment with the different
strategies and see how often you can make Alice and Bob lose! It can be run with
the `dotnet run` command.
