#Welcome!
This kata covers Quantum Arithmetic  -- how to implement basic addition, subtraction circuits in the quantum world.
    - information on classical ripple carry addition circuits can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics))
    - A great diagram of a ripple carry addition can be found on [CircuitsToday](http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ripple-carry-adder.png)
