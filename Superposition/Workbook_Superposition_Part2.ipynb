Instead of allocating a new qubit to use as the ancilla, we can use the first qubit in the register as the ancilla, because we are guaranteed to have that qubit be different between the two desired positions of the superposition.

    "This strategy can be applied to this task. First we will put the given register into the state dictated by the first bit string by walking through the register and the bit string together and performing an X on the current qubit when the current bit is 1. This will be the state based on the ancillaâ€™s $|0\\rangle$ state. We then will ask for an ancilla and put it into superposition with H. The qubit register already has the state in it that we want based on the ancillaâ€™s $|0\\rangle$ state, so we only need to add in the other position which will be based on the ancillaâ€™s $|1\\rangle$ state. We will walk through the register and the bit strings together. When we come across an iteration where the bit strings have different values, we will use the CNOT with the ancilla as a control and the current qubit in the register as the target. This will, bit-by-bit, flip the appropriate bits to change from the state described by the first bit string to the state described by the second bit string, and all such flips will be entangled to the $|1\\rangle$ state of the ancilla and will therefore not produce individual positions each, but one position. Lastly what we will do is uncompute the ancilla by using ControlledOnBitString with the second bit string and the X operation as arguments, the quantum register as the control, and the ancilla as the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible in the task to avoid using an extra qubit and instead use one of the qubits in the register as we previously used with the ancilla. While walking through the register and bit strings, the first time the bit strings disagreed, the corresponding qubit would take on the role of the qubit, putting it in superposition with H and all subsequent bit flips would use that qubit as the control. This saves us the need to ask for an additional qubit and means we can skip the uncomputing step."

    "As we did in  [superposition kata task 1.14](#superposition-of-two-bit-strings), we are going to use ancillae to achieve our superposition. As there are four positions in the desired superposition, we are going to need two ancillae to have a unique basis for each of the positions. We can start by putting the ancillae into superposition by applying H to each of them. Then, for each of the four bit strings, walk through the bit string and apply a controlled X with the associated ancillae state as the control. Having done this, the desired superposition will be achieved, but now we must uncompute the ancillae. As we did in [superposition kata task 1.14](#superposition-of-two-bit-strings), we will use ControlledOnBitString with the corresponding bit string and the X operation as arguments, the quantum register as the control, and the appropriate ancilla and the target. We will uncompute each ancilla separately, so one ancilla will be uncomputed with the bit[1] and bit[3] strings, and the other will be uncomputed with the bit[2] and bit[3] strings.

That way you end up with ($|10\\rangle$ + $|01\\rangle$)/$\\sqrt{2}$ and not just $|01\\rangle$. This can be done by using a controlled SWAP with an ancilla, we just need to be sure the uncompute the ancilla when we are finished. \n",

    "The problem may be more manageable if broken down into the simplest version of the problem. A single qubit is a bit uninteresting as there is only one qubit where the 1 can go, the state is simply $|1\\rangle$. Two qubits is a little more interesting though, we want to start with $|10\\rangle$ and do a controlled SWAP between the two qubits to get ($|10\\rangle$+$|01\\rangle$)/$\\sqrt{2}$ using an ancilla that has been prepared to the $|+\\rangle$ state with an H gate. Using an H gate on the ancilla means the two states before an after the SWAP will be in an even superposition. However, the ancilla is now entangled with the rest of the qubits, so we can't simply reset it without it affecting the superposition we have prepared with it. We will need to uncompute the ancilla by carefully considering what happened with it when we used it in the controlled SWAP. \n",

    "The ancilla was in superposition between $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. We want to return the ancilla to the $|0\\rangle$ state. The part of its superposition that is in the $|1\\rangle$ state needs to be returned to the $|0\\rangle$ state. This same part of the superposition was used in the controlled SWAP; controlled operators do nothing on $|0\\rangle$. If we collect up the effects of the SWAP and act on them, we will be acting only on the part of the entangled system where the ancilla was treated as $|1\\rangle$, and will be able to perform a Not on it to bring it back to $|0\\rangle$, without performing the same Not on the $|0\\rangle$ part of the ancillaâ€™s superposition. This translates to doing a controlled X on the ancilla with the effects of the SWAP as the control. For our 2-qubit example, the effect of a successful SWAP brings the register to $|01\\rangle$, so we can just use the second qubit as the control for our uncompute. \n",

    "If we take this one step further, we have a register of 4-qubits (only powers of 2 are allowed for the size). We can see that this is a scaled up version of the 2-qubit example. If we assume the first two qubits are in the W state, we simply want to SWAP that W state forward into the next two qubits with an even superposition. We again use an ancilla in the $|+\\rangle$ state and use it for a controlled SWAP of each qubit in the first half with the corresponding qubit in the second half. Now all that's left is the uncompute. The results from a successful SWAP is that the latter two qubits went from $|00\\rangle$ to ($|10\\rangle$+$|01\\rangle$)/$\\sqrt{2}$. The result of the SWAP, and consequently the $|1\\rangle$ state from the ancilla, is spread out over the latter two qubits, so we will loop through those qubits and use them in individual CNOT operations against the ancilla. \n",

All other interactions of the recursion will take require the the first half of the register being in its W state, and use an ancilla to control-SWAP that W state forward into its second half, then uncomputing the ancilla by applying a CNOT operation against the ancilla with each qubit from the second half of the register."
