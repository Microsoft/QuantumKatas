    "# Unitary Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"Unitary patterns\"** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed\n",
    "to teach you the basics of using Grover search to solve constraint\n",
    "satisfaction problems, using graph coloring problem as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.\n",
    "Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with the `// ...` comments)\n",
    "with some Q# code that solves the task. To verify your answer, run the cell using Ctrl/⌘+Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each section, tasks are given in approximate order of increasing difficulty; \n",
    "harder ones are marked with asterisks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task describes a matrix which your unitary needs to implement.\n",
    "The row and column indices of the matrix elements are in little-endian format (the least significant bit is stored first).\n",
    "For example, index 1 corresponds to the qubit state |10..0⟩, and to store this state in an array of qubits qs \n",
    "its first element qs[0] would have to be in state |1⟩ and the rest of the qubits would have to be in state |0⟩.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example patterns provided in the tasks, X marks a 'non-zero' element, and . marks a 'zero' element.\n",
    "'Zero' element of a matrix is a complex number which has an absolute value of 0.001 or less,\n",
    "and 'non-zero' element is a complex number which has an absolute value of 0.001 or greater.\n",
    "You can see the details of the verification in Tests.qs file, operation AssertOperationMatrixMatchesPattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all tasks require you to implement a unitary transformation,\n",
    "which means that you're not allowed to use any measurements."
