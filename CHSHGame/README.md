This is a Q# kata for the CHSH game, a quantum game where the players use
entangled qubits to help them win. The tests for each task in the kata can be
run using the "test" task in Visual Studio Code or with the `dotnet test`
command.

The kata also contains an experiment that shows what happens to the chance of
winning when Bob rotates his qubit by different angles. It can be run with the
`dotnet run` command.

This kata is based on the
[Q# CHSH game sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/Samples/src/CHSHGame)
by Microsoft.
