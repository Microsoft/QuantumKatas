    "When Bob holds 0, they still want to return the same parity, which they again do with 85.36% probability (left-hand case).  But when Bob holds 1, the AND condition is now true and the players want to answer in opposite parity.  This corresponds to the second and third elements of the above vector (right-hand case).  Thanks to the \"magic\" of the combination of the counterclockwise rotation and Hadamard transform, they now do this with probability $(0.6533)^2 + (0.6533)^2 = 0.8536$ and thus 85.36% becomes their win odds once more.\n",

While she and Bob would have a lock against the 0 bit, they would be on a coin flip if she held bit 1 and thus their win chance would revert to 75% again.\n",
