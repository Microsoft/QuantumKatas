# Welcome!

The "QFT (Quantum Fourier Transform)" quantum kata is a series of
exercises designed to teach you the basics of Quantum Fourier Transform.
It covers the following topics:
 - Basic Quantum Fourier Transform,
 - Ancillary Qubit Free Quantum Addition,
 - Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform,
 - Discrete Logarithm

Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.
Each task (except tasks in which you have to write a test) has a unit test associated with it,
which initially fails. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment)
with some Q# code to make the failing test pass.

#### Quantum Fourier Transform

We follow the standard algorithm described here:

* Nielsen, M. A. & Chuang, I. L. (2010). Quantum Computation and Quantum Information. pp.217-221

Here is a good references lecture note:

* [Lecture 9 Phase estimation (continued); the quantum Fourier transform](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/LectureNotes/CPSC519.Winter2006/09.pdf)

#### Quantum Arithmetic

For the QFT based quantum addition, see this paper:

* [Thomas G Draper. (2000). "Addition on a quantum computer". arXiv preprint quant-ph/0008033.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008033)

For the QFT based multiplication, see this paper:

* [Ruiz-Perez, L., & Garcia-Escartin, J. C. (2017). Quantum arithmetic with the quantum Fourier transform. Quantum Information Processing, 16(6), 152.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5949)

#### Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform

See this paper for a description and discussion of the algorithm:

* [Cheung, D. (2004, January). Improved bounds for the approximate QFT. In Proceedings of the winter international synposium on Information and communication technologies (pp. 1-6). Trinity College Dublin.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403071)
