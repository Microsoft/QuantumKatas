# Welcome!

The "QFT (Quantum Fourier Transform)" quantum kata is a series of
exercises designed to teach you the basics of Quantum Fourier Transform.
It covers the following topics:
 - Basic Quantum Fourier Transform,
 - Ancillary Qubit Free Quantum Addition,
 - Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform,
 - Discrete Logarithm

Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.
Each task (except tasks in which you have to write a test) has a unit test associated with it,
which initially fails. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment)
with some Q# code to make the failing test pass.
