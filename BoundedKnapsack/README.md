# Welcome!

The "BoundedKnapsack" quantum kata is a series of exercises designed to teach you to use Grover Search to solve the Knapsack Problem. The Knapsack Problem is a prominent computational problem that is very applicable in industries like e-commerce. The overall goal in this kata is to solve the Knapsack Optimization Problem, by running Grover's Algorithm multiple times. You will write oracles that describe the Knapsack Problem, and use these oracles in Grovers Algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem.

* More information on the Knapsack Problem can be found [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).
* It is strongly recommended to complete the [Grover's Algorithm kata](./../GroversAlgorithm/) before proceeding to this one. You can also refer to its [README.md](./../GroversAlgorithm/README.md) for the list of resources on Grover's algorithm.
* You may find this kata to be more challenging than other Grover Search katas, so you might want to complete [SolveSATWithGrover](./../SolveSATWithGrover/) or [GraphColoring](./../GraphColoring/) first.
* Much of the reference implementation provided in this kata is based off of circuits described in the paper "Quantum-based algorithm and circuit design for bounded Knapsack optimization problem" by Wenjun Hou and Marek Perkowski in the journal *Quantum Information and Computation*.
