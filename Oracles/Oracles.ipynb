    "In classical computing, the idea of white box versus black box testing is leveraged.  In white box testing, the implementation of the function, say to factor a number, is visable to the tester.  Thus the tester can test specific expectaions such as runtime or memory complexity.  However, in black box testing, the tester can only test the functionality and expected behavior of the function - the implementation has been abstracted away.\n",

    "An oracle in the quantum world is a black box operation that is utilized during an algorithm.  These **quantum oracles** are passed as input to quantum algorithms and they themselves require inputs to operate on.  A quantum oracle implements some function $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^m$ where $x$ is the input state of the form $|x\\rangle = |x_0\\rangle \\otimes |x_1\\rangle \\otimes ... \\otimes |x_{n-1}\\rangle$ There are two types of quantum oracles: phase oracles and marking oracles.  Each of these types oracles are defined based on their operations on their basis states, where these basis states are always $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.  Oracles must be unitary as well as not change the input if that input is a basis state of the oracle.\n",
