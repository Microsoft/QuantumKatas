    "# Truth Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial teaches you how to represent Boolean functions as\n",
    "integers.  We use the bits in the binary integer representation\n",
    "as truth values in the truth table of the Boolean function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a Boolean function is a function $f(x)$ : {0,1}$^n ->  ${0,1}\n",
    "that takes an n-bit input, called input assignment, and produces\n",
    "a 1-bit output, called function value or truth value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of an n-variable Boolean function as an integer with at\n",
    "least $2^n$ binary digits.  Each digit represents the truth value for\n",
    "each of the $2^n$ input assignments. The least-significant bit represents \n",
    "the assignment 00...00, the next one - 00...01, and so on, and \n",
    "the most-significant bit represents 11...11.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Q# we can use the 0b prefix to specify integers in binary notation,\n",
    "which is useful when describing the truth table of a Boolean function.\n",
    "For example, the truth table of the 2-input function ($x_1 \\wedge x_2$) can be\n",
    "represented by the integer 0b1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how you would get this representation: \n",
    "\n",
    "| $x_2$ | $x_1$ | $f(x_1, x_2)$ | Bit of the truth table\n",
    "\n",
    "| 0  | 0  |     0     | Least significant\n",
    "\n",
    "| 0  | 1  |     0     |\n",
    "\n",
    "| 1  | 0  |     0     |\n",
    "\n",
    "| 1  | 1  |     1     | Most significant\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of bits in a Q# integer is always the same, we need to\n",
    "specify the number of variables explicitly.  Therefore, it makes sense\n",
    "to introduce a user defined type for truth tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "newtype TruthTable = (bits : Int, numVars : Int);\n"
