    "The simplest thing we can do with multi-qubit systems is to apply gates to only part of the system. To demonstrate this, we will be applying single-qubit gates to a two-qubit system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to constructing multi-qubit systems out of tensor products of single qubits, you can construct compound gates out of tensor products of the underlying gates. For example, applying the $X$ gate to the first qubit and the $H$ gate to the second qubit would have the following matrix:\n",

    "Leaving a qubit unchanged is the same as applying the identity gate, so to apply a gate to only one qubit in the system, and leave the other unchanged, you can use the above method, and apply the identity gate to the unchanged qubit.\n",
