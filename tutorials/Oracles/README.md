# Welcome!

This folder contains a Notebook tutorial on Quantum Oracles to teach you what quantum oracles are, why they're important, and different types of oracles!  You will also get practice implementing some oracles on your own.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?filepath=tutorials/Oracles/Oracles.ipynb).  Alternatively, you can install Jupyter and Q# on your machine, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/jupyter), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from the command line using the following commmand:

    jupyter notebook Oracles.ipynb

The Q# project in this folder contains the back-end of the tutorial and is not designed for direct use.
