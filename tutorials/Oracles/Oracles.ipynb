    "In classical computing, we often discuss black box versus white box testing.  In white box testing, the implementation of a function, say to factor a number, is visible to the tester.  Thus the tester can test specific expectations such as runtime or memory complexity.  However, in black box testing, the tester can only test the functionality and expected behavior of the function - the implementation has been abstracted away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, most functions and data structures that we use while programming are a black box in our eyes - we are not worried with how an linked list is implemented, we only care about the functionality that it provides.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I provided you the following function:\n",
    "The function takes two parameters as input, two lists, where these lists represent the availability during the week of two different employees at a company.  The function returns if true if there is a day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday) for which they are both free and could schedule a meeting, if no such date exists then the function returns false.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous proposition is an example of a **classical oracle** because when interacting with this function, you are not worried with *how* the function determines the answer, you only care about *what* the answer is when provided a specific input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a **classical oracle** is a function that provided some input, it produces a *deterministic* output.  Hence the same input *always* results in the same output."

    "An oracle in the quantum world is a black box operation that is utilized during an algorithm.  These **quantum oracles** are passed as input to quantum algorithms and they themselves require inputs to operate on.  A quantum oracle implements some function $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^m$ where $x$ is the input state of the form $|x\\rangle = |x_0\\rangle \\otimes |x_1\\rangle \\otimes ... \\otimes |x_{n-1}\\rangle$.  Many quantum algorithms assume a proper implementation of some quantum oracle as input, but this is a very strong assumption.  Throughout the rest of this tutorial you will be exposed to quantum oracles and learn how to implement them.\n",

    "There are two types of quantum oracles: phase oracles and marking oracles.  Each of these types oracles are defined based on their operations on their basis states, where these basis states are always $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.  Oracles must be unitary as well as not change the input if that input is a basis state of the oracle.  Oracles also follow the same rules of linear algebra as normal matrices as they themselves are matrices, refer to the intro to review some of the properties of quantum operators (matrices)."
