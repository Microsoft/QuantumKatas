    "**What is this workbook?**\n",
    "A workbook is a collection of problems, accompanied by solutions to them. \n",
    "The explanations focus on the logical steps required to solve a problem; they illustrate the concepts that need to be applied to come up with a solution to the problem, explaining the mathematical steps required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a workbook should not be the primary source of knowledge on the subject matter; it assumes that you've already read a tutorial or a textbook and that you are now seeking to improve your problem-solving skills. You should attempt solving the tasks of the respective kata first, and turn to the workbook only if stuck. While a textbook emphasizes knowledge acquisition, a workbook emphasizes skill acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook describes the solutions to the problems offered in the [linear Algebra kata](./LinearAlgebra.ipynb). \n",
    "Since the tasks are offered as programming problems, the explanations also cover some elements of Python that might be non-obvious for a first-time user.\n",

    "1. Complex Arithmetic\n",

    "\n",
    ">*Python note:* In this workbook we will be using a lot of loop statements in Python. So, let's walk through the working of these statements first.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Lets start with `range(x)` this will create a range of numbers which you can integrate trough with `x` amount of items. For example `range(5)` will create a range with these items: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, this will be very useful for loops.  \n",
    ">\n",
    ">We can use the `for` function to iterate trough a range. The syntax for the `for` function is: ` for 'newVariableName' in 'range':`.  \n",
    "Assume we want to iterate trough 5 items and print all the values we can use the following code:\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">\n",
    ">for i in range(5):\n",
    ">    print(i)\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">This will print: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**For loops in matrices**: Matrices can be represented as 2d arrays, this comes down to embedding arrays within an array. For example take this matrix:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    ">\n",
    ">To express this in python we could use: `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`. To print each of these elements we will need to use 2 for loops, 1 for the rows and 1 for the columns.   \n",
    ">\n",
    ">If you want to access a specific element in the matrix you can use the index of that element in the array. If you want to access a specific element if this example array: `array = [0, 4, 3, 7]` you can use `array[index]` so if you want the `4` (2nd element) you can use `array[1]`, **index counting start form 0**.  \n",
    ">When using a matrix you can use a similar approach for example `matrix[0][2]` would access the first row and 3rd column.  \n",
    ">The example below shows how to initialize the above matrix and loop trough each element to print each value.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```Python\n",
    ">\n",
    ">matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">numberOfRows = len(matrix)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">numberOfColumns = len(matrix[0])\n",
    ">\n",
    ">for row in range(numberOfRows):\n",
    ">    for column in range(numberOfColumns):\n",
    ">        print(matrix[row][column])\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">In the code above the `len()` function is used, this can be used to get the number of items in an array. So looking at the code above `len(matrix)` will give 2 as there are 2 rows in the matrix. However if we do `len(matrix[0])` we are looking at the number of elements in the first array of the main array, this will give 3 as we have 3 columns. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Lastly, in most exercises a function named `create_empty_matrix(n, m)` is used, this is a custom function which gives you a matrix with size n x m will al 0's as values. This function is not a base function in Python so you have to create it yourself, in this notebook we defined the function as follows:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```Python\n",
    ">def create_empty_matrix(n, m):\n",
    ">    #Create new matrix\n",
    ">    ans = []\n",
    ">    #Loop trough each row of the matrix\n",
    ">    for i in range(n):\n",
    ">        #This will create an array with only 0's with the length m.\n",
    ">        newRow = [0] * m\n",
    ">        #We will now append this newly created row to the main matrix\n",
    ">        ans.append(newRow)\n",
    ">    return ans\n",
    ">```"

To represent a complex number we used tuples like these: `(real,imaginary)`, this was great to learn how to use complex numbers. However Python also has a native `complex` number data type, for more information [here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#complex) is the official documentation. Next to the data type Python also has the [cmath library](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/cmath.html), which has a lot of useful function to perform on complex numbers.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Using the `complex` data type is very intuitive, here we will give an example. The code below creates a new complex number with real and imaginary part and then return the polar representation of that number and print it. The code also shows how you could get the real and imaginary part of a complex number.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```Python\n",
    ">#Import the cmath library which has the complex number functions.\n",
    ">import cmath\n",
    ">\n",
    ">#Set the real and imaginary part of the complex number\n",
    ">real = 5\n",
    ">imaginary = 3\n",
    ">\n",
    ">#Create a new complex number with the real and imaginary part\n",
    ">complexNumber = complex(real, imaginary)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">#Get the real part of the complex number and prints this (result: 5)\n",
    ">print(complexNumber.real) \n",
    ">\n",
    ">#Get the imaginary part of the complex number and prints this (result: 3)\n",
    ">print(complexNumber.imag)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">#Convert the complex number to polar representation, using the cmath libary\n",
    ">polar = cmath.polar(complexNumber)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">print(polar) #This prints: (5.830951894845301, 0.5404195002705842)\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">To create the complex conjugate matrix we loop trough each element of the matrix and flip the sign for each of the imaginary parts of all elements. "

In this case when a 0 division is made it will reach the `except` part of the code and print that you can not divide those number, this part will only be reached when there is a divison error. "
