The probabilities of the measurement outcomes being $0$ and $1$ are $|\\alpha|^2$ and $|\\beta|^2$ respectively. Additionally, the state of the qubit is modified by the measurement. If the outcome of the measurement is $0$, then the post-measurement state of the qubit is $\\ket{0}$ (and similarly for $1$). In quantum mechanics, this is referred to as the [collapse of a wavefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse).\n",

    "> Unlike quantum gates which are unitary and reversible operations, in general, measurements in quantum mechanics are neither unitary nor reversible. Since outcomes of a measurement are probabilistic, any two isolated qubits which are initially prepared in identical superposition states are in general not guaranteed to have the same measurement outcomes after each qubit has been measured separately. As we will see below, measurements are modelled by projection operators instead of unitary operators.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Additionally, the assumption of the wavefunction being **normalized** is important for the applicablility of the statements above. This is because the probability outcomes must sum up to $1$. Only if the wavefunction is normalized, the probabilities add to one since the condition of normalization is equivalent to $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 \\neq 1$.\n"

It is also possible to implement measurements in other orthogonal bases, such as the [Pauli-X basis](../SingleQubitGates/SingleQubitGates.ipynb#Pauli-Gates), which consists of the two vectors $\\ket + = \\frac{\\ket 0 +\\ket 1}{2}$, and $\\ket - = \\frac{\\ket 0 - \\ket 1}{2}$. Q# has an inbuilt operation called [Measure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.measure) for measurements in the Pauli bases. The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are $\\pm 1$, with one eigenvector corresponding to each eigenvalue. For any chosen Pauli basis, the `Measure` operation returns `Zero` if the measurement outcome corresponds to the eigenvalue $+1$, and returns `One` if the measurement outcome corresponds to the eigenvalue $-1$. \n"

First, we note that the $\\ket 0$ vector is an eigenvector of the Pauli Z matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1$, while the $\\ket - $ vector is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $-1$. Hence, the `Measure` operation should return `Zero` if the measured state is $\\ket 0$, and `One` otherwise."

This is also consistent with the fact that global phases have no consequences on quantum measurements. For example, consider two isolated qubits which are in (normalized) states $\\ket \\psi$ and $e^{i\\theta}\\ket \\psi$. If both are measured in an orthogonal basis $\\{ \\ket{b_0},\\ket{b_1}\\}$, the probabilities of measuring $b_0$ or $b_1$ are identical in both cases, since $|\\bra{b_i}\\ket{\\psi}|^2 = |\\bra{b_i}e^{i\\theta}\\ket{\\psi}|^2  $. Similarly, for either qubit, if $b_i$ is the measurement outcome, the post-measurement outcome is $\\ket{b_i}$. Hence, the measurements are independent of the gloabl phase $\\theta$.\n",
