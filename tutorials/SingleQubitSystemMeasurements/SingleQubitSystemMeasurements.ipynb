The probabilities of the measurement outcomes being $0$ and $1$ are $|\\alpha|^2$ and $|\\beta|^2$ respectively. Additionally, the state of the qubit is modified by the measurement. If the outcome of the measurement is $0$, then the post-measurement state of the qubit is $\\ket{0}$ (and similarly for $1$).
