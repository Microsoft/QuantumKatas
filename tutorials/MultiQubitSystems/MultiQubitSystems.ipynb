    "\n",
    "Let's start with a system of two qubits, by first examining a system of two non-quantum bits. Each bit can be in two states: $0$ and $1$. Therefore, a system of two bits can be in four different states: $[0, 0]$, $[0, 1]$, $[1, 0]$, and $[1, 1]$. A system of two qubits can be in any superposition of these four states, and the elements of the vector represent how much of the system is in each of those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you can separate a multi-qubit system into the states of individual qubits.

    "\n",
    "> You might have noticed that we've been resetting the qubits at the end of our demos. Q# requires you to return your qubits into state $|0\\rangle$ before releasing them at the end of their <code>using</code> block. The reason for this has to do with entanglement. If you entangle a qubit with a quantum system, and then release that qubit, it remains entangled. If a different part of your program then receives that entangled qubit, it would be able to affect the rest of the quantum system through it, causing unpredictable and hard to debug behavior. Requiring you to reset the qubits you allocated forces you to pay attention to entanglement, and make sure you've unentangled your extra qubits before releasing them.\n",

You're probably familiar with the typical way of writing numbers in binary: $0 = 0_2$, $1 = 1_2$, $2 = 10_2$, $3 = 11_2$, $4 = 100_2$, $5 = 101_2$, $6 = 110_2$, etc. This is known as **big-endian format**. In big-endian format, the most significant bits come first. For example: $110_2 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 4 + 2 = 6$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There is an alternate way of writing binary numbers - **little-endian format**. In little-endian format, the *least* significant bits come first. For example, $2$ would be written as $01$, $4$ as $001$, and $6$ as $011$. To put it another way, in little endian format, the number is written backwards.\n",
