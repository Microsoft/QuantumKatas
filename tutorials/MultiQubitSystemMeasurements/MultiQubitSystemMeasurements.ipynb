    "### Theoretical basics: Partial and complete measurements\n",
    "Measurements in multi-qubit systems can involve measuring some of the qubits, or all of the qubits simultaneously. Somewhat counter-intuitively, complete measurements (i.e. measurements done on all the qubits simultaneously) are easier to understand than partial measurements. We start this tutorial with a discussion of measurements involving all the qubits in a system. As we will see in the section below, they are a straightforward generalization of measurements in single-qubit systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurement probabilities when all qubits are measured simultaneously\n",
    "Consider a system consisting of $n\\geq1$ qubits. The wavefunction of such a system will belong to a vector space of dimension $2^n$. Consequently, any orthogonal basis for this space will consist of $2^n$ vectors. An example is the computational basis, consisting of vectors $|0\\dotsc0\\rangle, \\dotsc, |1\\dotsc 1\\rangle$, where each ket contains a bitstring of length n. For generality, we consider an arbitrary orthonormal basis, which we denote by $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$. Then, the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ of the multi-qubit system can be expressed as a linear combination of the $2^n$ basis vectors. That is, there exist complex numbers $c_0,c_1,\\dotsc, c_{2^n-1}$ such that\n",
    " $$\n",
    " |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} c_i|b_i\\rangle.\n",
    " $$\n",
    " In line with the usual convention, we choose the wavefunction to be normalized, so that $|c_0|^2 + \\dotsc + |c_{2^n-1}|^2 =1$. Then, a quantum measurement in the $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$ basis satisfies the following rules:\n",
    " - The measurement outcome $b_i$ occurs with probability $|c_i|^2$. \n",
    " - Whenever the measurement outcome is $b_i$, the wavefunction collapses to the state $|b_i\\rangle$. That is, the post measurement state of the system is equal to $|b_i\\rangle$.\n",
    " \n",
    "> Similar to measurements in single qubit systems, the assumption of normalization of the original wavefunction is required for the applicability of the statements above, in order to ensure that the sum of all the outcome probabilities is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Whenever the wavefunction of a system is known in a certain basis, but a measurement is implemented in another basis, to obtain the measurement probabilities, it is best to first express the wavefunction in the basis in which measurements are to be done, and then apply the formulas above. "

    "\n",
    "Although it is possible to measure all qubits in a quantum mechanics system simultaneously, in practice, the qubits are measured one after another on a quantum computer. This distinction is not important for an ideal computer: in terms of the outcomes and measurement probabilities, measuring all the qubits in a system one after another is equivalent to measuring all the qubits simultaneously. Furthermore, as long as all the qubits are measured, the sequence in which they are measured is also inconsequential. (These factors play are important to consider for real quantum computers with imperfect qubits, but we restrict the discussion to ideal systems in this tutorial.) "
