    "In the previous tutorial, we discussed the concept of measurements done on single qubit systems. Building upon those ideas, this tutorial will introduce you to the concepts involved in, and the `Q#` implementation of measurements done on multi-qubit systems. This will involved measuring a single qubit in a multi-qubit system, as well as measuring multiple qubits simultaneously. \n",

    " Consider a system consisting of $n>1$ qubits. The wavefunction of such a system will belong to a vector space of dimension $2^n$. Consequently, any orthogonal basis for this space will consist of $2^n$ vectors. Let $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$ be one such orthonormal basis. Then, the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ of the multi-qubit system can be expressed as a linear combination of the $2^n$ basis vectors. That is, there exist complex numbers $c_0,c_1,\\dotsc, c_{2^n-1}$ such that\n",

    " |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} c_i|b_i\\rangle.\n",

    " In line with the usual convention, we choose the wavefunction to be normalized, so that $|c_0|^2 + \\dotsc + |c_{2^n-1}|^2 =1$. Then, a quantum measurement in the $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$ basis satisfies the following rules:\n",
    " - The measurement outcome $b_i$ occurs with probability $|c_i|^2$. \n",
    " - Whenever the measurement outcome is $b_i$, the wavefunction collapses to the state $|b_i\\rangle$. That is, the post measurement state of the system is equal to $|b_i\\rangle$.\n",

    "> Similar to measurements in single qubit systems, the assumption of normalization of the original wavefunction is required for the applicability of the statements above, in order to ensure that the sum of all the outcome probabilities is one."
