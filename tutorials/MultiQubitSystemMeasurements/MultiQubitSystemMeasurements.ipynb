Building upon those ideas, this tutorial will introduce you to the concepts involved in, and the `Q#` implementation of measurements done on multi-qubit systems. This will involved measuring a single qubit in a multi-qubit system, as well as measuring multiple qubits simultaneously. \n",

    "## Types of measurements\n",
    "Measurements in an n-qubit system ($n>1$) are of the following types:\n",
    "- Measuring all the qubits simultaneously in an orthogonal basis ($2^n$ possible outcomes) .\n",
    "- Pauli Measurements ($2$ possible outcomes).\n",
    "- Partial Measurements ($2^m$ possible outcomes, if $m<n$ number of qubits are measured).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two types of measurements involve measuring all the qubits in a system but result in a different number of outcomes, while the last type involves measuring only some of the qubits in the system. Partial measurements are more subtle than complete measurements, and hence we discuss these topics in the same order as the list above. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurements in multi-qubit bases\n",
    "Consider a system consisting of $n\\geq1$ qubits. The wavefunction of such a system belongs to a vector space of dimension $2^n$. Thus, the vector space is spanned by an orthogonal basis such as the computational basis which consists of the vectors $|0\\dotsc0\\rangle, \\dotsc, |1\\dotsc 1\\rangle$. For generality, we consider an arbitrary orthonormal basis, which we denote by $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$. Then, the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ of the multi-qubit system can be expressed as a linear combination of the $2^n$ basis vectors. That is, there exist complex numbers $c_0,c_1,\\dotsc, c_{2^n-1}$ such that\n",
    " $$\n",
    " |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} c_i|b_i\\rangle \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix}c_0 \\\\ c_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_{2^n-1}\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    " $$\n",
    " In line with the usual convention, we choose the wavefunction to be normalized, so that $|c_0|^2 + \\dotsc + |c_{2^n-1}|^2 =1$. Then, a quantum measurement in the $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$ basis satisfies the following rules:\n",
    " - The measurement outcome $b_i$ occurs with probability $|c_i|^2$. \n",
    " - Whenever the measurement outcome is $b_i$, the wavefunction collapses to the state $|b_i\\rangle$. That is, the post measurement state of the system is equal to $|b_i\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be summarized in the following table:\n",
    "<table style=\"border:1px solid\">\n",
    "    <col width=150>\n",
    "    <col width=150>\n",

    "## Measuring all qubits in a system one after another\n",
    "As described in the previous sections, in theory, it is possible to measure all the qubits in an n-qubit system simultaneously in an orthogonal basis. The post-measurement state of the qubits is then exactly one out of the $2^n$ possible basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is implemented by measuring all the qubits one after another. For example, if one wants to measure a two-qubit system in the computational basis, one can implement this by first measuring the first qubit in the computational basis to obtain 0 or 1, followed by a computational basis measurement for the second qubit. This can result in one of the four possible outcomes: $\\ket{00}, \\ket{01}, \\ket{10}, \\ket{11}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be generalized to measurements in other bases, such as $\\ket{++}, \\ket{+-}, \\ket{-+}, \\ket{--}$, and for a larger system sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is possible to measure all qubits in a quantum mechanics system simultaneously, in practice, the qubits are measured one after another on a quantum computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The distinction between measuring all the qubits simultaneously, as opposed to one after another is not important for an ideal computer: in terms of the outcomes and measurement probabilities, both are identical. Furthermore, as long as all the qubits are measured, the sequence in which they are measured is also inconsequential. (However, these factors can be  important to consider for real quantum computers with imperfect qubits, but we restrict the discussion here to ideal systems in this tutorial.) \n",

    "If a multi-qubit system is guaranteed to be in any one out of all the states in a specified orthogonal basis, then measuring the qubits in that basis can be used to identify the state of the qubits. In the cell below, we demonstrate this process for the computational basis. Specifically, we initialize a set of qubits in a randomly chosen computational basis state. Thereafter, we measure each qubit one after another in the the computational basis using the `M` operation in `Q#`. Finally, we print the measured state of the system. "
