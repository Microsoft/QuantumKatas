    "# Joint Measurements quantum kata\n",

    "**Joint Measurements** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed to get you familiar with programming in Q#. It covers the joint parity measurements and using them for distinguishing quantum states or for performing multi-qubit gates.\n",

    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.  Each task (except tasks in which you have to write a test) has a unit test associated with it, which initially fails. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment) with some Q# code to make the failing test pass. To verify your answer, run the cell using Ctrl/âŒ˜+Enter.\n",
